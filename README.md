**Overview:**  
This method of seed storage consists of converting a BIP39 24 word seed into its binary form then stamping it into a metal plate using a centre punch. 
This allows you to quickly make very cheap metal backups for your bitcoin seeds with minimal tools.

**Requirments:**  
-Metal plate of minimum size 39x72mm  
-Centre punch   
-Paper, tape & pen  
  
**Step 1: Prepare the metal plate**  
To reduce costs and identifiability this method does not need the metal to have any premade markings on the metal, instead you use a paper grid temporarily taped
to the metal. The grid is 13 columns (11 bits for the seed word, 1 blank space and 1 orientation mark) by 24 rows (24 seed words) with cells 3x3mm. Printable versions 
can be found in this repo, otherwise it is simple enough to hand draw with a ruler. The grid must then be securely fixed to the metal plate.

This is an example of one I made, the grid is taped to a credit card sized plate of 1.5mm stainless steel.
